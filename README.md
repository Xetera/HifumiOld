### Commands
#### Declaration
Commands are all declared under `src/commands/**/*.ts` and are globbed in `src/handlers/commands/CommandHandler.ts`.

The addition of a new command _only_ requires that a variable called `command` is exported somewhere inside `src/commands`

#### Parsing
Before commands are called, information is parsed in `src/parsers/argParse.ts`.

All command requirements like arguments and user/client permissions are declared in the **Command** object that is exported and parsed 
before calling the command.

A command is only called if these requirements are met.

All necessary arguments are passed into the `run` function's second parameter as a tuple.

[More info...](https://github.com/Xetera/Hifumi/blob/master/src/commands/README.md)

#### API

##### Anime 
Anime information is all taken from [AniList](https://anilist.co/) using graphql.

**"Wait a minute, anilist? How are you getting such accurate anime search results?!"**

Heh, as much as I love anilist and their API, unfortunately their search engine <sup>soon to be changed‚Ñ¢</sup> is really bad.
To get around this we use MAL instead... except not really. MAL's API is still either down or not working properly, also their API is  
from the stone ages so instead we only use the search hinting endpoint.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QFRs0Gu.png" height="200">

This search function for MAL seems to be operating independently from the rest of their API, you don't need any sort of authorization to 
make a request to the endpoint AND there's virtually no rate limiting. Plus, due to the nature of the search 
function, the responses are usually blazing fast.

`https://myanimelist.net/search/prefix.json?type=[all|manga|anime]&keyword=[url encoded query here]`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kBTCwhm.png" height="300">

The information that's returned is mostly irrelevant except for the order of the `items` array which represents the closest match
and the `id` property. Because AniList is so awesome, almost all of their entries also contain the MAL id of anime entries, meaning 
that all that's left to do is query AniList using the mal_id and that's it!

The only caveat is that sometimesMAL will return results based on popularity and not search match so it's necessary to go through all 
the results and look for a perfect case-insensitive match before we pull the first result in case a user searches for 
**Sword Art Online** or **New Game!!**.

### Database

[TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) is used for all database transactions.

A Redis cache layer is used to speed up common actions like fetching guild prefixes.

Database information is stored in `src/database` including
* Models
* Functions
* Migrations

For now, migrations are created manually for production are handled by TypeORM's CLI.

#### Backups
For database backups, python scripts are used to dump the current production db into Amazon S3 bucket.

This script is set on a cron job of regular intervals, and an X amount of backups are rotated inside the bucket, deleting the oldest version on every backup once X is reached to preserve limited bucket space.

A backup-restoration script is available to restore the latest backup if necessary.

## Setting Up Hifumi
Coming soon...

#### Inspired by [HotBot](https://gitlab.com/Aberrantfox/hotbot) in [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/programming)

#### This repo was not originally meant to be self-hosted or contributed to, so there's quite a significant chunk of code that's either hardcoded or made to be very convenient for Hifumi in specific. Although it will be made easier in the future, you're probably going to have a hard time trying to fork or self-host this repo as of now.
